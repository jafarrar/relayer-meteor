Authenticated request for /stats (CORS)
    ^ refactor for multiple uses - generic function for grabbing stats XML, then smaller ones that call it for: number of clients, updating list, maybe bitrate/resolution/etc?
Remove inactive applications/channels during update
write some tests, you filth
Slack hooks (went live etc)
Google analytics (including for jwplayer)
documentation: settings.json, default admin password, nginx-rtmp setup
Number of viewers https://github.com/arut/nginx-rtmp-module/wiki/Getting-number-of-subscribers
    - ^ this "works" now serverside, but always seems to show zero (probably a nginx-rtmp quirk, unsure how to adapt)
MAYBE: self-host JWPlayer, adapt jwplayer module principles
